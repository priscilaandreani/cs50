## About CS50x

**CS50x** is Harvard Universityâ€™s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

This course emphasizes problem-solving, both with and without code, focusing on correctness, design, and style. Topics covered include:

- Computational Thinking and Abstraction
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Memory Management and Low-Level Programming with C
- High-Level Programming with Python
- Databases and SQL
- Web Development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Rather than teaching just one programming language, CS50x provides a fundamental understanding of programming and equips students with the skills to learn new languages independently. The course begins with **C**, a foundational language that underlies many modern languages, helping students grasp low-level programming concepts. Later, it transitions to **Python**, making high-level programming more intuitive. Toward the end, students explore **SQL** for database management and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for web and mobile development. The course culminates in a **final project**, allowing students to apply their knowledge creatively.
